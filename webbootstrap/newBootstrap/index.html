				Jeremy Renner was born on January 7, 1971, in Modesto, California. He made his film debut in 1995â€™s National Lampoon's Senior Trip. After numerous guest spots, he won a recurring role on Angel in 1999. In 2002, he had his first major career breakthrough in the movie Dahmer. With his performance in 2009's The Hurt Locker, Jeremy Renner has established himself as one of Hollywood's rising stars.</p>

				<p>In 2007, Renner played a courageous soldier in the thriller 28 Weeks Later. He soon played another type of military officer in The Hurt Locker, which explored the travails of an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) team working in Iraq. "The role was so rich and complex, and the story of EOD made it so new and fresh. I trained with EOD for over a year to accurately portray these guys, these heroes," Renner told USA Today. 

				Renner's efforts paid off handsomely, winning him accolades for his compelling depiction of Staff Sergeant William James, an expert on defusing bombs who seemed to be addicted to the adrenaline rush associated with his work. Directed by Kathryn Bigelow, The Hurt Locker earned numerous award nominations, including an Academy Award nod for Renner.

				After the success of The Hurt Locker, Renner quickly became an in-demand actor in Hollywood. He appeared in the crime drama The Town (2010) with Jon Hamm, Ben Affleck and Blake Lively. Renner moved on to the popular action  franchise Mission: Impossible with a role in Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol. Assuming the identity of the comic book character Hawkeye, he played this part in both 2011's Thor and in 2012's The Avengers. </p>
